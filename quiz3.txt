Read the first two chapters in Allen Downey's book, The
Little Book of Semaphores.

Answer the "Puzzles", which are found on,

1) Page 2.
      Assuming that Bob is willing to follow simple instructions, is 
      there any way you can guarantee that tomorrow you will eat
      lunch before Bob?

   (This is actually answered for you on the following page.)

   You can use a technique called message passing to guarantee you eat before Bob. 
   To do message passing, you can tell Bob to eat lunch when you call him. As a result you eat lunch than call Bob after. 

2) Page 5 (3 puzzles)
      What path yields output 5 and final value 5.
      B1<A1<A2
      What path yields output 7 and final value 7.
      A1<B1<A2
      Is there a path that yields output 7 and final value 5? Can you
         prove it?

    No path yields output 7 and final value 5, you would think B1<A2<A1, but A1 has to be executed before A2.  
    You can prove this by creating a tree of permutations of every execution path and you can show that in no case that the output is 7 and the final value is 5.

       

   In answering these questions, it would be the sequence of events, or
   that a certain sequence is not possible.

3) Page 6
      Supposse that 100 threads run the following program concurrently.
      ... [the program]
      What is the largest possible value of count after all the threads
      have cmompleted?
      10,000

      If there is no interleaving of threads than it would be 100X100.
      What is the smallest possible value?
      2
      Thread 1 stores the value of count in temp which is 0 and thread 1 halts. Then all other threads finishes their execution except thread 99 halts before the last iteration of the loop.
      Thread 1 finishes it's execution and now count is set to one. 
* this is wrong
Thread 99 finishes it's last iteration of the loop and it's last execution, setting count to 2.

      Thread 1 can be any thread and for this example be used thread 1 and thread 99.

      Give some reason for your answers. It is harder to give reasons
      for what cannot happen.  
 
4) Page 6
      Figure out a system of message passing (phone calls) that enforces
      these restriants. Assume there are no clocks, and you cannot predict
      when lunch will start or how long it will last. What is the minimum
      number of messages that is required?

Person 1 calls Person 2 when their lunch begins. Person 2 cannot begin lunch until Person 1 calls back after lunch is done.
Therefore, their are only two messages. When Person 1 starts lunch and when person 1 ends lunch. 
Person 2 is halted and cannot start lunch during that time.
